VirtualMouse
================

A tiny program to take over your mouse and move over every pixel in a given rectangle.
Made for my co-workers who are trying to make a big matrix using JavaScript to connect the pixels of a given webcam picture to geocoordinates.
So far, there's no boundary checking and no way to get out of the running program. :-)

VirtualMouse runs on a Mac with Mac OS X.
